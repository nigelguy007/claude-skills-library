# Cookiy AI — Open-Source User Research Skill for AI Agents

**Cookiy AI User Research Skill** is the open-source, MIT-licensed agent skill powered by the world's first agentic AI user researcher. Plan, run, and synthesize real user research — qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys — without leaving your AI agent.

**The human layer in the AI stack** — give any AI agent direct access to real human opinions, experiences, and decision-making.

## What is this?

An AI agent skill that enables any AI platform to **plan, run, and synthesize user research** — both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (surveys) — without leaving the conversation.

Use it for **general-purpose research** (design research plans, interview guides, synthesize reports), or connect to **Cookiy AI** to run **end-to-end studies** with real or synthetic participants.

---

## Capabilities

| | Capability | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Plan** | Research Planning | Generates research plans, screening questionnaires, and interview guides |
| **Synthesize** | Report Synthesis | Turns raw interview transcripts into evidence-backed reports with codebooks, personas, and prioritized findings |
| **Qual** | Qualitative Studies | AI-moderated interviews with real or synthetic participants, via Cookiy AI |
| **Quant** | Quantitative Surveys | Multi-language surveys with conditional logic, respondent recruitment, and results — via Cookiy AI |

2. `Plugins` > `Personal` > `user-research-skill`, click `+` on `User research`
3. (**Claude Cowork only**) Enable network access: `Profile` (bottom left) > `Settings` > `Capabilities` > `Code execution and file creation` > turn on `Allow network egress`, then set `Domain allowlist` to `All domains` — or add `s-api.cookiy.ai` under `Additional allowed domains`.

### Claude Chat Desktop

1. Download the [Skill ZIP file](https://github.com/cookiy-ai/user-research-skill/releases/download/latest/user-research-cookiy-skill.zip)
2. In the app: `Customize` > `Skills` > `+` > `Create Skill` > `Upload a skill`
3. Enable network access: `Profile` (bottom left) > `Settings` > `Capabilities` > `Code execution and file creation` > turn on `Allow network egress`, then set `Domain allowlist` to `All domains` — or add `s-api.cookiy.ai` under `Additional allowed domains`.

### Claude Code Terminal

```bash
/plugin marketplace add cookiy-ai/user-research-skill
/plugin install user-research@cookiy-ai
/reload-plugins
```

**Optional — enable auto-update:** `/plugin`, then choose `Marketplaces` tab > `cookiy-ai` > `Enable auto-update`

### Codex / Cursor / OpenClaw / Other Agents

```bash
npx cookiy-ai
```

Or follow your agent's skill installation instructions to install manually.

## Usage

- Type `/user-research-cookiy` to explicitly invoke the skill.
- Or just describe your research goal — your agent will load the skill automatically based on semantic matching.

## Examples

> *"I want to understand why users churn after onboarding"*
> — Designs a research plan, screener, and interview guide targeting early-stage drop-off.

> *"Here are 20 interview transcripts, give me a report"*
> — Runs a five-phase synthesis pipeline and produces a structured report with themes and personas.

> *"Run a study on how developers choose CI/CD tools"*
> — Via Cookiy AI: creates the study, runs AI-moderated interviews, and delivers the report.

> *"Survey 200 users about feature satisfaction"*
> — Via Cookiy AI: designs a survey, recruits respondents, and collects results.
