  Stress-test an existing pitch deck with a 7-test investor-lens audit battery: Headlines Tell the
  Story, Team Placement, 5-Second Test, Narrative Arc, Anti-BS Check, Investor Psychology, and
  Structural Completeness. Use when the user wants to review, audit, critique, grade, or improve an
  existing pitch deck, investor deck, or fundraising presentation (Marp markdown or PDF). Produces a

# Pitch Deck Audit

Run a 7-test audit battery on an existing pitch deck. Accepts Marp markdown or PDF.

## Input

Read the deck file provided as argument. If PDF, read all slides. If no argument given, ask the user
for the path.

## Audit Battery

Run ALL 7 tests. For each, output **PASS** / **WEAK** / **FAIL** with specific evidence from the
deck.

### Test 1: Headlines Tell the Story ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

Extract every slide headline in order. Present them as a numbered list. Then evaluate:

- Read sequentially: do they tell a complete, compelling investment story WITHOUT body text?
- Is each headline a MESSAGE not a label? ("Team" = FAIL, "Team engineered for this opportunity" =
  PASS)
- Does the sequence build emotional momentum? Left hook, right hook alternation?
- Does headline sequence start with biggest statement and end with compelling close?
- Could an investor read ONLY the headlines and want to take a meeting?

**This is the single most important test.** If headlines don't tell the story, the deck fails
regardless of content quality.

### Test 2: Team Placement

Evaluate whether team slide placement is optimal:

- **Team early / first** when: founder has personal connection to problem, industry expertise is the
  moat, "why us" IS the story, team credibility makes everything else believable
- **Team later** when: product/traction speaks louder than bios, team is strong but not the
  differentiator
- If founder story creates "why this person, why this problem" conviction, team should be in first
  3-5 slides
- Founder origin story ("I lived this problem for X years") makes audience listen more carefully to
  everything after
- At early stage: 80-90% of deal is team. If team slide is buried at slide 15, that's usually wrong

### Test 3: 5-Second Test (Per Slide)

For each slide: if shown for 5 seconds and removed, can viewer state the message?

- One message per slide?
- Clear visual hierarchy — eyes know where to go?
- Max 30 words (40 absolute max)?
- Text readable (>20pt) or intentionally decorative (<13pt)?

### Test 4: Narrative Arc

- Does deck follow visceral > logical progression?
- Is there a "why now" moment?
- Does it build from problem > solution > proof > ask?
- Are there dead slides that break momentum?
- Does closing reprise the opening commercial?

### Test 5: Anti-BS Check

- Any invented or unverifiable claims?
- Top-down market numbers without bottom-up backing?
- Superlatives without proof?
- Competition hidden or dismissed?
- Numbers consistent across all slides?
- Traction vs action — is real traction shown, or just activity?

### Test 6: Investor Psychology

- Are the 3-5 partner talking points obvious from the deck?
- Are major objections pre-defanged?
- Is the risk onion visible — what's already peeled, what this round peels?
- Would an IC committee member have enough to champion this?

### Test 7: Structural Completeness

Check for missing critical elements:

- [ ] Hook / 30-second commercial
- [ ] Problem (visceral, not abstract)
- [ ] Solution (clear, differentiated)
- [ ] Market (bottom-up)
- [ ] Traction (earned, not done)
- [ ] Team (why THIS team for THIS company)
- [ ] Business model
- [ ] Competition (full disclosure)
- [ ] Financials
- [ ] Ask + use of funds
- [ ] Appendix / Q&A arsenal

## Output Format

## Critical Issues (FAIL)

[issues that will kill the pitch]

## Weaknesses (WEAK)

[issues that reduce effectiveness]

## What's Working (PASS)

[what to keep and amplify]

## Reference Material

For the frameworks behind these tests (Headline Writing, Seven Moats, Onion Theory, Traction Rules,
presentation budgets, anti-patterns), see [`../references/reference.md`](../references/reference.md).
This audit does not require it, but it is useful when rewriting headlines or proposing a reorder.
